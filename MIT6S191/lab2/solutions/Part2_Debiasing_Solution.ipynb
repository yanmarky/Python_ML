In order to formalize this, we'll need to think about [*latent variables*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable), variables that define a dataset but are not strictly observed. As defined in the generative modeling lecture, we'll use the term *latent space* to refer to the probability distributions of the aforementioned latent variables. Putting these ideas together, we consider a classifier *biased* if its classification decision changes after it sees some additional latent features. This notion of bias may be helpful to keep in mind throughout the rest of the lab. "

As a result, a classifier trained on CelebA will be better suited at recognizing and classifying faces with features similar to these, and will thus be biased.\n",

        "How could we overcome this? A naive solution -- and one that is being adopted by many companies and organizations -- would be to annotate different subclasses (i.e., light-skinned females, males with hats, etc.) within the training data, and then manually even out the data with respect to these groups.\n",

Second, it requires that we know what potential biases (e.g., race, gender, pose, occlusion, hats, glasses, etc.) to look for in the data. As a result, manual annotation may not capture all the different features that are imbalanced within the training data.\n",

If certain features, such as dark skin or hats, are *rare* in CelebA, the model may end up biased against these as a result of training with a biased dataset. That is to say, its classification accuracy will be worse on faces that have under-represented features, such as dark-skinned faces or faces with hats, relevative to faces with features well-represented in the training data! This is a problem. \n",

Specifically, to build a debiased facial classifier, we'll train a model that **learns a representation of the underlying latent space** to the face training data. The model then uses this information to mitigate unwanted biases by sampling faces with rare features, like dark skin or hats, *more frequently* during training. The key design requirement for our model is that it can learn an *encoding* of the latent features in the face data in an entirely *unsupervised* way.
