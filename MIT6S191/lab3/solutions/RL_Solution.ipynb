        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n",

        "1.   In many cases, games have perfectly describable environments. For example, all rules of chess can be formally written and programmed into a chess game simulator;\n",
        "2.   Games are massively parallelizable. Since they do not require running in the real world, simultaneous environments can be run on large data clusters; \n",
        "3.   Simpler scenarios in games enable fast prototyping. This speeds up the development of algorithms that could eventually run in the real-world; and\n",

        "In previous labs, we have explored both supervised (with LSTMs, CNNs) and unsupervised / semi-supervised (with VAEs) learning tasks. Reinforcement learning is fundamentally different, in that we are training a deep learning algorithm to govern the actions of our RL agent, that is trying, within its environment, to find the optimal way to achieve a goal. The goal of training an RL agent is to determine the best next step to take to earn the greatest final payoff or return. In this lab, we focus on building a reinforcement learning algorithm to master two different environments with varying complexity. \n",

To access the Cartpole environment, we can use `env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\")`, which we gained access to when we imported the `gym` package.

Much like you might use `numpy.random.seed`, we can call the comparable function in gym, `seed`, with our defined environment to ensure the environment's random variables are initialized the same each time."

Since we (and the agent) is uncertain about if and when the game or task will end (i.e., when the pole will fall), it is useful to emphasize getting rewards **now** rather than later in the future -- this is the idea of discounting. This is a similar concept to discounting money in the case of interest. Recall from lecture, we use reward discount to give more preference at getting rewards now rather than later in the future.

We achieve this by simply **scaling** the probabilities by their associated rewards -- effectively amplifying the likelihood of actions that resujlt in large rewards.\n",

This function can be thought of as a \"rollout\", where the agent will 1) make an observation of the environment, 2) select an action based on its state in the environment, 3) execute a policy based on that action, resulting in some reward and a change to the environment, and 4) finally add memory of that action-reward to its `Memory` buffer. We will define this algorithm in the `collect_rollout` function below, and use it soon within a training block.\r\n",

As you may have gathered, in a dynamic game like Pong, it can actually be helpful to consider the difference between two consecutive observations. This gives us information about the movement between frames -- how the game is changing. We will do this using the `pong_change` function we explored above (which also pre-processes frames for us).\r\n",

These observation changes will be forward propagated through our Pong agent, the CNN network model, which will then predict the next action to take based on this observation. The raw reward will be computed. The observation, action, and reward will be recorded into memory. This will loop until a particular game ends -- the rollout is completed.\r\n",
